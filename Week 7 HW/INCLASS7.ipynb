      "4. \"With an Air Travel Card, passengers could \"buy now, and pay later\" for a ticket against their credit and receive a fifteen percent discount at any of the accepting airlines\" - The specific mention of a fifteen percent discount could be false as discounts may have varied.\n",
      "5. \"In 1948, the Air Travel Card became the first internationally valid charge card within all members of the International Air Transport Association\" - The claim that it was valid \"within all members\" could be false as some members might not have accepted it.\n",
      "6. \"The concept of customers paying different merchants using the same card was expanded in 1950 by Ralph Schneider and Frank McNamara, founders of Diners Club, to consolidate multiple cards\" - These individuals may not have been the first to consolidate multiple cards into one. \n",

      "9. \"It was eventually licensed to other banks around the United States and then around the world, and in 1976, all BankAmericard licensees united themselves under the common brand Vi\" - The timeline and details of the licensing agreement could be incorrect.\n",

      "4. “The branch was transferred to the University of California, becoming the Southern Branch of UC in 1919.\" - While UCLA did join the University of California system in 1919, it was not initially referred to as the \"Southern Branch\".\n"
